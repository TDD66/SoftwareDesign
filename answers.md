# Software Design Methodologies

## 1. What do we mean by coupling and cohesion when discussing structured design?

Cohesion refers to how much properties in a class 'truly' belong together. A highly cohesive module would be a module that is made up of properties that a tightly related to eachother in purpose.

Coupling refers to how dependent a module is to another module. Loosely coupled modules are desired as they are easier to change and more modular to test.

## 2. What is the difference between top-down and bottom-up design? Which best describes a function oriented design?
